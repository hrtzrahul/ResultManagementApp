 ### Installation


    1. Navigate to the project directory:
       ```bash

    ### Database Setup

    To run the application smoothly, you need to set up the database and tables. Follow these steps:

    1. Create a new database named **demo2** in your DBMS.

    2. Run the following queries to create the required tables:

       - Teachers Table:
         ```sql
         CREATE TABLE demo.teachers (
           teacherid VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
           password VARCHAR(25)
         );
         

       - Students Table:
         ```sql
         CREATE TABLE demo.students (
           roll NUMERIC PRIMARY KEY,
           name VARCHAR(25),
           date_of_birth DATE,
           score NUMERIC
         );
         ```

    3. Insert a teacher's login credentials:
       ```sql
       INSERT INTO demo.teachers (teacherid, password)
       VALUES ('1234', 'abc123');
      

    ## Usage
